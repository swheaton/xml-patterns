===== Singleton / Monostate =====
Either the Builder or Abstract Factory needs to become a Singleton or Monostate.
Document is currently the Abstract Factory for the Builder, which makes it
difficult for it to be a Singleton. I don't want to make Document a Singleton,
and I also don't want to make a separate Abstract Factory, because then the created
elements lose their ownerDocument information.

So I've made Builder be a Singleton by following the implementation given by the
GoF and creating a static instance. The ramifications of this are that the Builder
can only create *one* document across all users of the class. This seems
inappropriate for a general XML library, but perhaps we know that there must be
only one DOM tree, and it is built up by all users.
