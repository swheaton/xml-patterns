==== Command ====
To implement the Command pattern, I created a base class Command that only has
one virtual void function execute(). There are three ConcreteCommands that derive
from the Command class: ParseFileCommand, SerializeCommand, and AddAttributeCommand.
The Receiver for these ConcreteCommands is a dom::Node* for the first two and a
dom::Element* for the third. If we had a framework built up around this DOM library,
we would have an Invoker that is given these Commands by the Client and calls their
execute() method at some point.
