Reimplement the serialization algorithm or some part of it, either the original or your Strategy, using Template Method, by identifying the variant and invariant parts of the algorithm. 
Apply Fowler’s refactoring “Form Template Method.”

Implement a Builder using XMLTokenizer to construct a DOM tree. Use Abstract Factory to create the Builder’s object creation component. (I won’t grade on the bugginess of your parser. I’m interested in the Builder.) 
Follow Kerievsky’s refactoring “Encapsulate Composite with Builder.”





=====================



A little fuzzy on this one right now especially since we’ve already modified the serialization algorithm and further modifications just seem overkill to me at this point.  However, I can see the serialize() function being moved to Node as a template, with the invariant parts being the order of the variant functions, the writer printing out a string, and iterating through any children.  The variant parts would be functions like startSerialize(), getOutputString(), and closeSerialize().
