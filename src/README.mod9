===== Memento =====
To allow preservation of the the XMLValidator class, I created a Memento class
inside XMLValidator. Its state is the schema vector that XMLValidator has. The
only public function on Memento is the destructor, which provides the narrow public
interface. XMLValidator, as a friend class, is the only one that can create a
Memento through the createMemento() function. When creating Mementos or restoring
from them, we have to do a deepy copy of the schema vector. I also created an
XMLValidatorSave class that acts as the Caretaker on XMLValidator, providing save()
and revertToLastSave() functions.
